# Development dependencies - editable installs
# These packages should be installed in editable mode during development

# Install with: uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# Check if packages are editable: uv pip list --format=json | jq '.[] | select(.name | test("cast-|django-cast|django-indieweb")) | {name: .name, editable_project_location: .editable_project_location}'

# Note: uv run --with-requirements doesn't install packages as editable,
# so you need to install them manually first with: uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# The 'just dev' command preserves editable installs (doesn't run uv sync)
